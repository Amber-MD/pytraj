This file includes tips for whatever

1. Check if libcpptraj having openmp
nm libcpptraj.so | grep omp_

2. Don't try to use absolute_import for all files. Would get import error
(hell knows why)

3. git merge conflict
* currently we push cythonized files to git. However, I frequently get merged conflicts
for those *.cpp files when pushing/pulling from different computers (due to different cython/python version)

The solution (seems dummy):
    + create seperate git folder just for pulling source (from pytraj/pytraj github)
        * update change by "git pull" (don't make any change here, just for pulling update)
    + `cd your_working_dir`
        + manually copy cythonized files (*cpp) to your working dir, 'git add' and 'git commit' 
        + then just 'git pull from_pytraj_pytraj_github_alias' 
          (where `from_pytraj_pytraj_github_alias` is your desired name)

4. if compiling cpptraj with openmp, need to do this with pytraj too.
if not: will get some memory errors for some Actions.
