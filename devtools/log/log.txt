* Oct - Nov 2014: Start writting pycpptraj

* Nov-11-2014: Start writing gencode.py to automatically convert cpptraj header file to python (*.pxd and *.pyx) files

* Nov-14-2014: Finish importing all (most?) cpptraj functions (most header files) to Cython. Passed 229 tests (./src/tests/test_*.pyx)

* Dec-04-2014: Write setup.py and test installing

* Dec-11-2014: Know how to create wrapper for abstract and sub-class

* Jan-24-2015: Taking 3D numpy array just by traj[:, :, :] or traj[0:20, :, :] (read only)

* Jan-29-2015: working on pip: python setup.py sdist
    * good tutorial: http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html
    * to test:
        * python setup.py register -r pypitest
        * python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
    * to upload:
        * register: python setup.py register
        * upload: python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi

* Jan-31-2015: working on porting code to Python3. Stuck
    * Error: "TypeError: expected bytes, str found". tried but don't know how yet.
        Try: filename = filename.encode("UTF-8") (work well for the communication between C++ string and Python3 string)
    * us 2to3 to make compat: 2to3 --output-dir=python3-version/mycode -W -n python2-version/mycode
